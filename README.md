# dsif-capstone-project

This project uses Lending Club data application dataset to develop a predictive model for loan applications. The project has two parts:

1. A notebook which has three sections - data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and modelling
2. A report which has five sections - methodology, model assessment, solution architecture, model use and project impact

In conjunction, both parts of the model set out the approach to developing a model aimed at reducing the number of potential default loans granted to improve the Lending Club's net interest income
